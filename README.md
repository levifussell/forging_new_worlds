## Forging New Worlds: high-resolution synthetic galaxies with chained generative adversarial networks  ##

Suplementary code for the paper, **Forging new worlds: high-resolution synthetic galaxies with chained generative adversarial networks** found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03081.pdf).

Currently this repository only contains models for generating galaxies using our chained GAN model. Future code for training the model will be available soon.
